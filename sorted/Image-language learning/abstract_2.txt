Image-language learning is an emerging field that bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities using deep learning techniques. This interdisciplinary approach enables models to understand and generate text descriptions for images, perform visual question answering, and support multimodal translation tasks. Advances in transformer architectures, such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Contrastive Learning frameworks like CLIP, have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of these systems. Applications span from automated captioning and accessibility tools to robotics and interactive AI assistants. Future research aims to refine cross-modal alignment, enhance data efficiency, and improve generalization across diverse visual and linguistic domains.
