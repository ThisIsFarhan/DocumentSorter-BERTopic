Speech recognition technology has advanced significantly with the development of deep learning models, enabling machines to accurately transcribe spoken language into text. Modern speech recognition systems leverage neural networks, particularly recurrent and transformer-based architectures, to process and interpret audio signals in real-time. Applications range from virtual assistants and transcription services to accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities. Challenges such as speaker variability, background noise, and multilingual support continue to drive research in the field. Future improvements aim to enhance accuracy, reduce latency, and enable seamless human-computer interactions across diverse environments.
